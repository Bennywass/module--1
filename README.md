# Overview

{This program is a number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and user only has
10 tries in order to accomplish the task. This program is accomplished using a variety of functions, loops and variables to help with tasks.}

{This purpose of writing this program was to build an understanding of Java and its unique syntax.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{For this program, I used VSCode to write my program and used Java as my language.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- The main thing I wanted to add that I couldn't get to work was to have a loop that would allow the game to run
  multiple times. I built a framework of a loop, but the game would just end instead of continuing.
- I would like to change how writing to files work so that it writes each guess into the file more like as a list.
- Lastly, I would like to display the results of the file to the user so that they can see all of their guesses.
